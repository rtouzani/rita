# rita Script file to solve a 1-D problem by P1 finite elements
#
# Generate a uniform 1-D mesh of 10 elements
# The default domain is the interval (0,1)
# Associate code 1 to end nodes enforce Dirichlet bc later
# We enter module 'mesh'

  1d ne=10 codes=1
# We leave the 'mesh' module
  end

# Define equation: PDE and discretization method
# Default is stationary analysis
# We define the equation to solve and prescribe boundary condition and source
# We also define space discretization method: P1 finite element method
# We enter module 'pde'
